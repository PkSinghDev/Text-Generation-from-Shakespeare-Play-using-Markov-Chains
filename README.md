# Text Generation from Shakespeare Play using Markov Chains
## Create understanding of Markov Chains and build a Shakespeare Writer from scratch

According to the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, William Shakespeare wrote close to a tenth of the most quoted lines ever written or spoken in English. What's more, according to the Literature Encyclopedia, Shakespeare is the second most quoted English writer after the writers of the bible. During his life, William Shakespeare wrote at least 37 plays, 154 sonnets, and a number of poems! that we know of. In addition, there are a number of "lost plays" and plays that Shakespeare collaborated on. This means Shakespeare wrote an average of 1.5 plays a year since he first started writing in 1589.

How cool will it be to build a Shakespeare like AI writer using his plays?? Interesting isn't it?? So let's start. <br />
In this article, we will go through the following: -<br />
 - Loading necessary libraries & dataset<br />
 - Preprocessing using keras tokenizer<br />
 - Understanding Markov Chains & k-word Markov Chains<br />
 - Generating text via a simple algorithm using a random starting point.<br />
